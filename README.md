# Something

This is **something**. It is a simple template site / design concept created with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Viewing the site

The site is pre-built and statically hosted at [something.ler.sg](https://something.ler.sg) on Cloudflare Pages.

If the site has already been built, you can view the generated html, css and js files in the build folder.

To view the site using a development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

The default url to view the site locally is [localhost:6131](http://localhost:6131).

## Building

To build the site into html files:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
