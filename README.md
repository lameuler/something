This is a template site created with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Viewing the site

If the site has already been built, you can view the generated html, css and js files in the build folder.

To view the site using a development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To build the site into html files:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
